# Template for human RNA-seq using Illumina prepared samples. 
##same for single or paired end reads.  Paired end reads will be identified by notation R1 and R2 (read 1 and read 2) of the fastq files.

##genome_build: hg19-ercc will automatically map to genome with ERCC spike in standards added in

##the rest of the inputs are standard for most RNAseq applications
